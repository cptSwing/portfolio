In effect, it can be used to quickly prototype models, or texture models according to the model's coordinate axes (ie top/bottom, left/right).\n\nSo I sat down again and started from scratch.\n\n For now, this uses [CustomShaderMaterial](https://github.com/FarazzShaikh/THREE-CustomShaderMaterial) to extend a THREE.MeshStandardMaterial. It supports basecolors, normal maps, and roughness maps for now, and is currently object-space only.\n\nI'd love to build a world space shader sometime soon, but first I would like to get rid of the CSM dependency and move towards a v1 release.\n\nCheck out the source [here](https://github.com/cptSwing/three-triplanarmapping), and a test scene (built with react-three-fiber, still very unoptimized) [here](https://www.jbrandenburg.de/bundles/triplanar)"

The initial version is [here](https://github.com/cptSwing/cpts-tailwindcss-utilities) - I've yet to put it through it's paces and haven't actually tried any rounding, but it's currently doing it's job on this here website, for instance! \n\n Usage is easy: `clip-inset-2`, `clip-inset-1/2` etc will clip content on all sides according to the same values as used in tailwind's `w-2` or `w-1/2` respectively (I am using the predefined 'width' values actually). \n\n`clip-inset-t` and `-r`, `-b`, `-l` clip the top, right, bottom left sides. `clip-inset-x` and `clip-inset-y` take care of horizontal and vertical sides.\n\nI'm now adding more plugins, there is a mask-edges available now as well, equally beta but also in production use alread ;)"
