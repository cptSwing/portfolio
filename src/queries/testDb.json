We choose to realize the project - which also included a shop front with order forms etc - using ***react***, ***react-three-fiber*** (a ***three.js*** wrapper), as well as adjacent libraries.\nIn parallel, Vragments is developing a new Product Management System for Henrich & Denzel, and interaction between the ring-configurator and the PMS via API took on an increasingly large role."

These would ostensibly be scaled in width and diameter and look okay, within certain limits.\nLater on, the limits of scaling such meshes became apparent, and we had to return to the drawing board. While the capability to load individual rings as *GLTF* would be kept for certain rings, we would now create ring meshes on the fly, extruding 2d splines - loaded from DXF files - along a circular curve or along a provided curve of different shape."

The whole scene was UV-mapped to two large textures, and - in many iterations - I baked shadowmaps as well as some others from within 3D Studio Max. Layered together, these would give depth to the surfaces, defining crevices and highlighting edges. Muted colors were added via another layer, or multiplied via exported vertex colors.\nSome surfaces did use lit shading, most notably the glass areas, as well as some metals (airplane models, for instance). This iterative process, with a close eye on texture size and performance (repeating/mirroring texture detail as much as possible, cutting extra geometry into meshes in order to use areas of the already baked texture, etc) constituted a large amount of the time I spent on the project."

The initial version is [here](https://github.com/cptSwing/tailwind-css-plugins/blob/main/twClipInset.ts) - I've yet to put it through it's paces and haven't actually tried any rounding, but it's currently doing it's job on this here website, for instance! \n\n Usage is easy: `clip-inset-2`, `clip-inset-1/2` etc will clip content on all sides according to the same values as used in tailwind's `w-2` or `w-1/2` respectively (I am using the predefined 'width' values actually). \n\n`clip-inset-t` and `-r`, `-b`, `-l` clip the top, right, bottom left sides. `clip-inset-x` and `clip-inset-y` take care of horizontal and vertical sides."

Some things will likely break outside of a specific environment - I had to adjust how webpack outputs sourcemaps, for instance - so obviously YMMV."
