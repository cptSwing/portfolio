### TODO

## unordered:

 - Select for instances? (get rid of Hex mesh)
 - HTML ZPos (menutitles) = Menuitem's max Z in animate()

- react to mouseover on grid and translate HTML/CSS3D element
- use CSS3D instead of <HTML> ? no transforms in ortho for the latter it seems?
- css mouse-cursor effects on scene objects? draw hexagon element (via clipping? svg?) and use in <HTML> / CSS3D?
